The main aim of this project is to develop an Application which helps the users to get the services at home directly
by choosing the services they want to be done on their selected time and their own selected vendors. The users can select
the services and then they would have a flexibility to select the vendors they want service from by looking at the reviews of 
all the service providers.
After the user has selected the services they want, they would receive a notification regarding their order. 
The vendor would also get a notification as the order has been placed by the user to their services. 
There would be some access privileges provided to the regular customers as well as the ones who selects
a certain amount of services at a time. There are Google Maps implemented where in a user can get the nearby
vendors and get the speedy services. 
The idea proposed is providing the services to the customers from the vendor nearby and getting 
the professionals with best of their ability in that service with total customer satisfaction and authentication. 
There are almost all the services which are in common to thumbtack like type of services provided to the customers, location assistance,
notifications, etc. But there is one thing which makes this application unique is the rewards which the customers would get 
according to their credibility and frequency by which they use the application and books services. This would make the customers 
use the application in frequent as well as the regular customers would get all the perks of being Regular.
